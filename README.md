QUTEBROWSER NORD THEME
===

This is a theme made for qutebrowser by *anaconda* (KnownAsDon).<br>
It was made using python and it uses the color palette of the
[nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) theme.<br>
This original file was taken by a
[solarized](https://www.reddit.com/r/qutebrowser/comments/77eqiq/solarized_or_base16_color_theme_for_qutebrowser/)
theme in a reddit post so for the moment some of the credits go to the person of
the reddit post too but it is only temporarily until the file becomes completly
redesigned.

Future Plans
---
I am planning on working more on this theme and give more of a polish look
into it and as well build a completly new file as I mentioned above but for know
you will have to stick with what you've got. Anyone who wants to contribute or
use the theme for him/her self is free to do so.
